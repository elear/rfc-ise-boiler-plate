   Caution: This specification is neither a standard nor a product of
   the IETF community consensus process.  It makes use of
   cryptographic algorithms that are national standards of CCCC,[ as
   well as ISO/IEC standards (ISO/IEC NNNNN:M-YYYY...)].  Neither the
   IETF nor the IRTF has analyzed those algorithms for suitability for
   any given application, and they may may contain either intended or
   unintended weaknesses.
