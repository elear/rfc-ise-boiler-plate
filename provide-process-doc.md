Dear author(s),

Thanks for your interest in publishing an RFC in the independent
series.  The process for handling of submissions is documented in (RFC
4846)[https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc4846] and on [our
website](https://www.rfc-editor.org/about/independent/).  Please note
the template on that page.

To get things going you must first submit an Internet-Draft.  Tooling
for writing and producing Internet-Drafts may be found
(here)[https://authors.ietf.org].

Once you have submitted the draft to the datatracker, please contact me
again at this address with the completed template I mentioned above, and
we'll take things from there.

Eliot Lear  
Independent Submissions Editor
