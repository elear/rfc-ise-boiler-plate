Hi XXX

The Independent Submissions Editor is considering draft-xyz for
publication as an informational RFC in accordance with RFC 4846. In
order to make a publication decision, I seek competent reviews of the
material under consideration.  I wonder if you could take some time to
read through this draft and answer some questions found at
https://www.rfc-editor.org/materials/reviewer.guide.txt.

Normally, your review will be provided to the authors and may be made
public.  However, if you like, I can anonymize the source.  Your review
can also serve to improve the underlying quality of the work.  Some back
and forth with the authors generally helps that process.

I ask that reviews be complete within a month.  Would you be willing
to take this one on?

Thank you in advance,

Eliot Lear  
Independent Submissions Editor
