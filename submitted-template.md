Authors,

I have noted your submission of draft-xyz.  You should see some email
indicating that the draft is now marked as under consideration as an
independent submission, and the state in the data tracker will be set
to "submitted".

As mentioned on [our website](https://www.rfc-editor.org/about/independent/),
here is the way things generally proceed:

1. ~~Submit a draft~~
2. ~~Fill out the independent submissions template found at the top of this page~~
3. ~~Submit the template to the Independent Submissions Editor~~
4. Initial ISE review
5. Commissioned reviews
6. Follow-up ISE review
7. IETF Conflict Review
8. Follow-up ISE review
9  Initial publication decision
10. Submission to the RFC Production Center (RPC)
11. AUTH48
12. Publication

So congratulations!  You've gotten through the first three steps, and really
writing the draft is probably the hardest part.  This having been said,
the Independent Submissions Editor reserves the right to decline publication
at any time prior to that last step 12, so we have a ways to go.

I will be in touch once I have performed my initial review.

Eliot Lear  
Independent Submissions Editor
